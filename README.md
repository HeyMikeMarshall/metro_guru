# Metro Guru

Welcome to the Metro Guru source repository.

This is a web application project by Michael Marshall (@HeyMikeMarshall). This project was born from a school project in a Data Analytics and Visualization course I've taken at George Washington University, and I will be the first to admit that this project was lovingly inspired by DC Metro Hero https://dcmetrohero.com. I can only hope that I get this project to be as well made and informative as Metro Hero.

This application is currently deployed to Heroku https://metro-guru.herokuapp.com
